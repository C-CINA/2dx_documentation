\section{Automatic Image Processing}

In this section we provide detailed hands-on instruction on automatic image processing within 2dx \cite{scherer20142dx_automator}, including on-the-fly image drift-correction. The here described pipeline is optimised for data recorded on a direct electron detector, such as the Gatan K2 summit. 

\subsection{Real-time motion-correction}

In case you record dose fractioned movies we propose the drift-correct them on-the-fly as described in:

\textit{https://github.com/C-CINA/2dx/wiki/Automatic-Drift-Correction-C-CINA-setup}

Additionally instruction about setting up our automatic drift-correction pipeline is available under:

\textit{https://github.com/C-CINA/2dx/wiki/Automated-Drift-Correction-GUI}

2dx\_automator will later be used to automatically process the drift-corrected average of all frames.

\subsection{Required software}

2dx\_automator is only supported under Linux right now.
Please make sure that the list of dependencies is installed on the used system.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{TkInter} a python GUI package
	\item \texttt{py-thread} to be able to dispatch processing into different tasks
	\item \texttt{py-imaging (aka PIL)} the python image processing libraries
	\item \texttt{eman2/sparx} has to be installed and sourced on the system
	\item \texttt{py-matplotlib} to generate plots
	\item \texttt{py-shutil} for low-level operating system interaction
	\item \texttt{ImageMagic} especially the command-line tool \texttt{convert} has to be available
\end{itemize}

Additionally 2dx\_automator requires that \texttt{2dx\_image, 2dx\_merge} are available in the command line. If you installed a pre-compiled package please add 2dx's binary directory to your path:

\texttt{export PATH = /opt/2dx/bin:\$PATH}

If you compiled the software from source directly on your computer you should source the installation-binary folder as well:

\texttt{export PATH = <your\_install\_dir>/bin:\$PATH}

where \texttt{<your\_install\_dir>} equals the second argument passed to the \texttt{build\_all}-script. If you did not pass any argument to the build-script then \texttt{<your\_install\_dir>} equals \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/2dx/}.
