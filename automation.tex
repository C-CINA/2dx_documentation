\section{Automatic Image Processing}

In this section we provide detailed hands-on instruction on automatic image processing within 2dx \cite{scherer20142dx_automator}, including on-the-fly image drift-correction. The here described pipeline is optimised for data recorded on a direct electron detector, such as the Gatan K2 summit.
